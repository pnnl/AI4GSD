1. Running Jupyter Notebook in Ubuntu.
1a. Assuming you have an environment for AI4GSD called "sfa" (or any other name you use)
1b. Activate Python environment in terminal, type: conda activate sfa
1c. Install Jupyter if not already installed: pip install jupyter
1d. Run Jupyter Notebook by type: jupyter notebook in sfa terminal.

2. Running Jupyter Notebook in Windows.
2a. When running the code in Jupyter Notebook, you may find the code cannot find installed packages. This may be related to wrong kernel selection. This occurs when there are more than one environment in the anaconda. To fix this, it is required to "Install ipykernel" in the correct user environment.
2b. For AI4GSD, do the following to install your (for example, sfa) kernel: 
pip install ipykernel
python -m ipykernel install --user --name your_env_name --display-name "Python (your_env_name)"

2c. After the install of the sfa kernel, then you can start the Jupyter NoteBook and then select the desired kernel.
